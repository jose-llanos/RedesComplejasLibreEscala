# complex_networks_in_EA

This is the repo for the code implemented in: Traveling Salesman Problem Using a Evolutionary Algorithm guided by Complex Networs

You can find 4 python files:

1. evnormal.py -> the classic EA algorithm for TSP
2. sw_tsp.py -> the proposed algorithm with complex networks with random neighbour selection
3. swbest.py -> the proposed algorithm with complex networks with best neighbour selection
4. swhd.py -> the proposed algorithm with complex networks with highest degree neighbour selection

In each file you can setup and change the desire parameters in order to test.
For default, the files are with parameters for non scalability initial tests 

Also for graphics generation:

5. scalability.py -> a python script to generate the scalability 3D graphics for the paper 
6. graphics.nb -> where we generate the graphics using Mathematica, for the analysis by the average scores obtained from the python files
